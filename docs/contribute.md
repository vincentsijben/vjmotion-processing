## Contributors

This template was created as part of the 2024 New Beginnings (pr05) Grant from the
[Processing Foundation](https://github.com/processing), to simplify the
workflows for libraries, tools, and modes, mentored by [@Stefterv](https://github.com/stefterv).

It is based on and inspired by a number of Processing library templates, including:

- [https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template-gradle](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template-gradle)
- [https://github.com/enkatsu/processing-library-template-gradle](https://github.com/enkatsu/processing-library-template-gradle)
- [https://github.com/hamoid/processing-library-template/](https://github.com/hamoid/processing-library-template/)

I wish to thank the developers of these repositories, who generously provided
guidance and time. This template has been developed in collaboration with
[@enkatsu](https://github.com/enkatsu).

The example library was developed by Stig MÃ¸ller Hansen ([@stixan](https://github.com/stixan)).
